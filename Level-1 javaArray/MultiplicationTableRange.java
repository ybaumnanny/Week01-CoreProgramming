/*Create a program to find the multiplication table of a number entered by the user from 6 to 9 and display the result
Hint => 
Take integer input and store it in the variable number as well as define an integer array to store the multiplication result in the variable multiplicationResult
Using a for loop, find the multiplication table of numbers from 6 to 9 and save the result in the array
Finally, display the result from the array in the format number * i = ___
