        The  Gregorian Calendar Formula is used to calculate the day of the week for a given date is based on the
		assumption that the months are numbered from March as 1 to February as 12 as the calendar year in this formula runs from
		March to February, not from January to December. 
		
		This is how the formula works:

        Month: January and February are treated as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
        Year: When calculating the day of the week for January or February, the year is adjusted
		(decreased by 1) because these months are part of the previous year calendar according to this formula.
		 
		For January 2025 (month 1), the formula would adjust the month and year as:
		month = 1, which is less than or equal to 2, so:
        month += 12 that is month = 13
        year-- that is year = 2024
        Now the formula calculate the first day of January 2025 as the first day of the 13th month of 2024.
